      <h2 class="heading4">Introducing About Electronic Vehicles</h2><br>
      <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are automobiles that are propelled by one or more electric motors, using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device. They have gained significant popularity in recent years due to advancements in battery technology, environmental concerns, and efforts to reduce dependence on traditional fossil fuels. EVs are generally considered to be more environmentally friendly than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles as they produce no tailpipe emissions.</p>

        <p>A Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is a type of electric vehicle that is powered solely by an electric battery and an electric motor, with no internal combustion engine. BEVs are part of the broader category of electric vehicles (EVs), which also includes plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).</p><br><br>

         <p>A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid electric vehicle whose battery pack can be recharged by plugging a charging cable into an external electric power source, in addition to internally by its on-board internal combustion engine-powered generator. Most PHEVs are passenger cars, but there are also PHEV versions of sports cars, commercial vehicles, vans, utility trucks, buses, trains, motorcycles, mopeds, military vehicles and boats.</p>

         <p>Driving a hybrid car is quite similar to driving a conventional automatic car. However, the performance difference is significant. The common myth regarding hybrid electric vehicles MATLAB simulation is the preconceived notion of the less range provided because of the word electric combined with their names.</p>
         <p>A hybrid electric vehicle or HEV, is the future of automobiles where people can experience gasoline power and electric power in one car. The electric power fuels the motor and the gasoline powers the ICE. This results in an enormous amount of torque and pace for the car.

          They not only provide a better range but also keeps a check over the fuel meter. It is fantastic to have the power of gas fuel and electric energy, which helps maintain your car's efficiency.</p>

          <p>Extended-Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs) represent a type of hybrid vehicle that combines aspects of both electric and traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) technologies. The primary distinguishing feature of EREVs is their ability to operate on electric power alone for a significant range before relying on a gasoline-powered generator to extend their overall range. This concept is often associated with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, EREVs have a distinct design and operational focus.</p>
